# Expense_Tracker
**"A simple and intuitive expense tracker built with Flutter. Add, categorize, and visualize expenses with ease. Features include interactive charts, swipe-to-delete with undo, and quick overviews. Clean UI, and a seamless user experienceâ€”perfect for keeping track of spending!"** ðŸš€ðŸ’°

ðŸ’° Built My Own Expense Tracker â€“ Hereâ€™s How It Went!
So, Iâ€™ve been working on a little side projectâ€”a simple yet functional expense tracker to help keep spending in check. I wanted something clean, easy to use, and actually helpful. And after some time coding away, hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ve got so far:

ðŸš€ What It Can Do Right Now
âœ… Add & categorize expenses â€“ Food, travel, games... you name it.
 âœ… Visual breakdown â€“ A clean bar chart to quickly see where your money is going.
 âœ… Swipe to delete (with undo!) â€“ Because we all make mistakes.
 âœ… Sleek UI â€“ Minimal, modern, and smooth animations for a great user experience.
ðŸ”§ Whatâ€™s Missing (For Now!)
ðŸ’¡ No storage yet â€“ Right now, expenses disappear when you close the app. Thinking of adding local or cloud storage soon.
 ðŸ’¡ No edit option â€“ You can add and delete expenses, but not update them.
 ðŸ’¡ Better data insights â€“ Right now, tapping a chart bar gives totals, but Iâ€™d love to add more filters & comparisons to make budgeting smarter.
 ðŸ’¡More Categories â€“ Allowing user to add a bunch of other categories.
 
ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Flutter (Dart) â€“ Because cross-platform is king.
State Management â€“ Stateful and set state( ).
Animations & UI â€“ Built with Material Design for a smooth experience.

This project has been a fun way to sharpen my Flutter skills and build something actually useful. ðŸš€ Still a work in progress, but Iâ€™d love to hear what you think!
